# CAB202-Final-Project: Simon Game

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is an implementation of the **Simon Game** on an embedded system as part of the **Final CAB202 Project**.
The game consists of four buttons (S1 to S4) corresponding to each button on **QUTY**,
each producing a distinct tone when pressed.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Skills Learned

- **Assembly Language:** Understanding low-level programming for embedded systems.
- **C on Embedded Systems:** Writing efficient C code for hardware interaction.
- **State Machine:** Implementing a structured approach to game logic using state transitions.
- **Modular Programming:** Organizing code into reusable and manageable modules.

## 🔧 Key Features

1. **Button Interaction:** Each button triggers a specific sound and response.
2. **State-Based Logic:** The game follows a sequence of states, ensuring smooth gameplay.
3. **Embedded C Implementation:** Optimised code for hardware constraints.

📖 **Developed as part of CAB202 coursework at QUT 2023.**
